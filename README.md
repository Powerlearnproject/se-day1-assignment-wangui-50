#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is defined as the process of designing, developing, testing and maintaining software applications. It is very crucial in the technological industry as it drives innovation by ensuring that there is creation of new software products that enhance productivity, efficiency and convinience in various sectors.
Software engineering practices also allow and ensures that software developed is of high quality, reliable and ensures its security which is very vital.
Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
Development of programming languages for example Fortran and C. Fortran which stands for Formula translation was a crucial advancement in the field of programming. It was one of the first high-level programming languages created and specifically tailored for scientific and engineering computations. This development marked a significant shift towards a more user-friendly programming methods making it easy to solve problems.
The advent of structured programming in the 1970s. Structured programming was a shift that emphasised the use of clear, well-organised code structures to improve the readability, maintainability and efficiency of software development. It promoted the use of control structures like conditionals, loops to break programs into smaller manageable modules.
Rise of agile methodologies in the 2000s. Agile revolutionized the software development process by promoting iterative and incremental approaches to project management. It has had a great impact on how software is developed, emphasizing adaptability, customer feedback and teamwork as core principles in modern software engineering practices.
List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
Planning. This phase involves gathering equipments, defining goals and creating a project plan. This phase is very important as it lays the foundation for the entire development cycle.
Design. In this phase, there is the creation of system architecture and a detailed design based on the requirements that were gathered in the planning phase.
Development. In this phase, the actual coding takes place. Developers write code based on the design specifications, following best practices and coding standards that have been provided.
Testing. Once the software has been developed, it undergoes testing to ensure it functions correctly and meets the requirements and standards. It includes various levels susch as unit testing, integration testing, system testing and user acceptance testing.
Deployment. After a successful testing, the software is now ready to be deployed to the production environment for end-users to access and use. This phase involves releasing the software and making it available to users.
Maintenance. This is the final phase and it involves mainataining and updating the software to ensure itmains relevant, functional, secure and up-to-date with the changing requirements or technologies. This phase ensures that the software continues to meet user needs over time.
Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
Waterfall methodology. 
It follows a linear and subsequent approach in that for one to go to the next phase the previous phase needs to have been completed.
It also allows for extensive planning in the requirements and design phases.
Changes are difficult to implement once the project moves past a certain phase.
Waterfall methodology is best suited for projects that have well defined and stable requirements, where the end goal is clear from the beginning.
A best case scenario for waterfall methodology can be and example of a project that is supposed to build a simple website with clearly defined requirements and a fixed scope. This is because the requirements are stable and unlikely to change.
Agile methodology.
Agile follows and iterative approach with short development cycles called sprints. Therefore it allows for flexibility and adaptability.
Planning is done incrementally throughout the project thus allowing for changes based on feedback.
Agile prioritizes customer collaboration over following a plan.
Agile methodology is best suited for projects that have evolving requirements, where flexibility and quick responses to changes is very crucial.
A best case scenario for agile methodology is when a team wants to develop a mobile app where requirements might evolve based on the user feedback. Therefore there is continuous improvement.
Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software developer
Coding. Software developers write clean, efficient code based on specifications provided by the project team. They can use programming language like java, python and others to come up with software applications.
Testing. Developers are also responsible for testing their code to ensure it is effective and functions correctly.
Debugging. Software developers also conduct troubleshooting when issues or bugs arise in the software to identify and fix the problem.
Collaboration. Developers work closely with the team members such as designers, project managers, quality assurance to ensure the software meets the requirements and standards set.
Quality assurance engineer
Testing. QA engineer are responsible for designing and executing text cases to identify defects in the software.
Quality standards. QA engineer ensures that the software meets quality standards and follows best practices. They establish quality metrics and guidelines for the development team.
Bug tracking. QA engineer tracks and reports bugs or issues found during testing and work closely with the developres to resolve the issues.
Vlidation. QA engineer validates that the software meets the specified requirements and functions correctly according to the design specifications.
Project Manager
Planning. Project managers are responsible for creating project plans, defining project scope, setting timelines and allocating resources effectively to ensure project's success.
Risk management. Project managers identify potential risks to thee project and develop strategies to mitigate or address these risks effectively.
Resource management. Project managers manage resources, including team members, budget, tools to ensure the project is completed efficiently.
Problem solving. Project managers are adept at problem solving and decision making. They address issues that arise during the project and help find or come up with effective solutions to keep the project on course.
Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDE is a software application that provides all the tools and features developers need in one place to write, test and debug their code. IDEs are impotant in that they provide a centralized platform where developers can write, test and debug code efficiently. They provide features like code editors, build automation tools and debugging capabilities, streamlining the development process and enhancing productivity. An example of IDE is visual studio code. It is a popular and versatile IDE that supports various programming languages,offers extensions for customization and integrates seamlessly with version control systems like Git.
Version Control System. This is like a time machine for your code. It basically keeps track of all the changes made to the codebase, allowing developers to collaborate, manage different versions of the code. VCS tracks changes to code. It ensures code integrity and provide a history of changes made to the codebase. An example of VCS is Git. It is a distributed version control system that allows developers to work on projects simultaneously, merge code changes efficiently and mainatain a complete history of all the changes.
What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Tight deadlines. Engineers often find themselves in situations where there is limited time for completion of a project or task and can often create pressure. A good strategy to help them overcome this can be deploying an effective time management strategy where they can break tasks into smaller achievable goals, prioritizing work based on deadlines helps in meeting prodect timelines.
Technical Debt. In software it refers to like accumulating a pile of work that needs to be done later. It happens when shortcusts are taken during the development process leading to suboptimal code quality. A strategy that can be deployed for this is to regularly address technical debt through refactoring, code reviews and allocating time for improving existing code to ensure long-term maintainability and scalability.
Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
Unit testing. It involves testing individual components or units of code in isolation to ensure they work correctly. Unit testing helps identify bugs early in the development phase and ensures that each unit functions properly and as intended.
Integration testing. This type of testing focuses on testing how different units or modules work together as a group. It helps uncover issues that arise when units interact with each other ensuring that the integrated components function correctly.
System testing. It evaluates the behavior of a complete and fully integrated software product. It verifies that the software meets specified requirements and functions properly in the intended environment.
Acceptance testing. It involves testing the software from an end-user perspective to determine if it meets the user's requirements and is ready for deployment. It ensures that the software is acceptable for delivery to customer.
#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering involves crafting well-designed prompts or instructions to interact with AI models effectively. In interacting with AI models, prompt engineering is crucial because it helps users communicate their intentions clearly and precisely to the AI system. By crafting well-structured prompts, users can get accurate and relevant responses from AI models leading to more effective communication and problem- solving.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
''What's the weather like?'' - vague prompt
''Could you please provide a detailed forecast for the weather in Ngong, Rift Valley Province, Kenya for the next 3 days?''
The improved prompt is more effective as it specifies the location and timeframe for the weather forecast, making it easier for the AI model to generate a relevant and accurate response tailored to the user's needs.
